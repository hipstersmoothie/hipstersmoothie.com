                  Pitchfork has been around for decades reviewing 2-4 albums a
                  day. While the reviews can be quite critical, they are
                  entertaining and offer a guide to consuming lots of music you
                  might not have heard of otherwise. Unfortunately their

                  Pitchforkify combines every review Pitchfork has ever

                <p className="text-xl mb-6">
                  The site also allows you to filter the review by genre, score
                  and date to help you find old gems. You can also see how your
                  likes on spotify have scored in the reviews. My average is
                  7.6!
