                  website a tool to be and "automated hipster". It creates an

                  . Pitchfork has been around for decades reviewing 2-4 albums a
                  day. While the reviews can be quite critical, they are
                  entertaining and offer a guide to consuming lots of music you
                  might not have heard of otherwise. Unfortunately their
                  websites doesn't an offer an easy way to play the music you're

                  Pitchforkify combines every review Pitchfork has ever
                  published with a player connected to spotify. Listening to the
                  day's album reviews is as easy as pressing play on the first
                  album.

                  The site also allows you to filter the review by genre, score
                  and date to help you find old gems. You can also see how your
                  likes on spotify have scored in the reviews. My average is
                  7.6!

                  Due to this site breaking almost all of spotify's API rules,
                  only approved accounts can use it. If you want to try it out
