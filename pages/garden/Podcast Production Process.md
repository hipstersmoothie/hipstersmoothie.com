# Podcast Production Process

The current publishing process for an episode of [[devtools.fm]].
We should automate more of this (well at least publishing).

## Editing

1. **First Pass:**

   - Remove as many filler words as you can
   - Fix glaring issues in transcript
   - Fix large pacing issue
   - Make cuts of things that shouldn't be in the episode

2. **Second Pass:**

   - Hide video
   - Fix transcript
   - Fix Grammar
   - Fix timing issues
   - Make cuts

   **Timing style guide:**

   - If people take super long pauses shorten it to `.5-1s`
   - If a sentence starts with a filler word, super repeated word, or a false start I remove it
   - Remove mid sentence filler word if the audio still works

3. **Third Pass:**

   - Run at `3x` speed
   - Make video cuts and switch between speakers

4. Add intro and outro
5. Add section markers
6. Break sections that are 8+ minutes into clips for secondary YouTube account
